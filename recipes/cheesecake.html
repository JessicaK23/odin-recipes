    <br>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>300 g packet of Hobnobs</li>
        <li>150 g dark chocolate (70%)</li>
        <li>8 overripe bananas</li>
        <li>½ x 450 g jar of dulce de leche</li>
        <li>500 g light cream cheese</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Rub the base of a 20cm springform cake tin with olive oil and line with greaseproof paper, then rub the paper with oil, too.</li>
            <li>Melt 50g of chocolate in a heatproof bowl over a pan of gently simmering water, then remove.</li>
            <li>Snap the Hobnobs into a food processor and blitz with 2 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil until well combined.</li>
            <li>Drizzle in the melted chocolate, then pulse again. Pat into the cake tin in a 1cm-thick layer.</li>
            <li>Peel the bananas, tear into the food processor, add the cream cheese and dulce de leche, blitz well until nice and smooth, then pour over the biscuit base.</li>
            <li>Freeze overnight or until needed, transferring to the fridge for 2 hours before serving, or until it’s the slicing consistency you like.</li>
            <li>Loosen the edges of the cheesecake with a palette knife, then release from the tin. Shave or grate over the remaining chocolate, and serve. Delicious.</li>
            </ol>
